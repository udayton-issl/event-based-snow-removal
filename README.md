# Event-Based Snow Removal

This repository provides source code for the Event-Based Snow Removal (EBSnoR) algorithm. Along with the algorithm source code, several other utility scripts are provided in order to aid with experimentation. See the READMEs in `Python` and `Matlab` for more information.

## EBSnoR algorithm

The source code for the EBSnoR algorithm can be found in the following scripts:

- `Matlab/EBSnoR.m`
- `Python/EBSnoR/ebsnor.py`
